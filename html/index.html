<h1>Control Board</h1>

<p>Control Board is a RoboFont extension for communicating with Arduino-compatible devices using the Firmata library.</p>

<p>It turns physical input events from components connected to the Arduino (pressing buttons, toggling switches, turning knobs) into "ControlBoardInput" event notifications, and turns "ControlBoardOutput" notifications into changes in state of the output components connected to the board (toggling LEDs on and off or changing the color of RGB LEDs, moving motors, etc.)</p>

<p>It makes generous use of the Breakfastserial, pyFirmata and serial Python libraries:</p>

<h2>A special Arduino note for Mac OS 10.9 and 10.10 users:</h2>

<p>Before you begin, Mac OS 10.9 and 10.10 users will need through a small process of updating the FTDI drivers that came with their computer, in order to be able to communicate with the Arduino.</p>

<p>You can read more about this requirement from the Arduino forum, or just follow the steps listed below.</p>
http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=198539.0

<p>1) Start by disabling the FTDI drivers that came with your Mac. From the Terminal, type the following commands     
<pre>    cd /System/Library/Extensions/IOUSBFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns 
    sudo mv AppleUSBFTDI.kext AppleUSBFTDI.disabled 
    sudo touch /System/Library/Extensions</pre></p>

<p>2) Restart your computer</p>

<p>3) Then, install the correct FTDI drivers, found here:
<pre>    http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm</pre></p>

<p>You will want to choose either the 32-bit or 64-bit drivers depending on which Mac you have. To find out whether your machine is 32 or 64-bit, have a look here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT3696</p>

<p>4) After restarting your computer once more for good measure, you will be ready to communicate over USB with your Arduino.</p>


<h2>Arduino Setup:</h2>

<p>To use Control Board, you'll need to upload the Standard Firmata library on your Arduino.</p>
 
<p>1) Start by downloading the Arduino IDE software:
<pre>    http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software</pre></p>

<p>2) Plug in your Arduino, and launch the the Arduino application</p>

<p>3) From the "File" menu, open "Examples > Firmata > Standard Firmata"</p>

<p>4) From the Tools menu, under the "Board" section, choose which kind of Arduino board you're using, and from the "Serial Port" section, choose the name of a serial port which contains "USB".</p>

<p>5) Then, click the "Upload" button at the top of the StandardFirmata window, the button that has the image of an arrow.</p>

<p>If all goes well, in a moment your Arduino will have the Standard Firmata library installed on it, and you'll be ready to use Control Board. You will only need to set your Arduino up once, it will retain this Standard Firmata library until you upload a new program to it another time.</p>



<h2>Control Board Quick Start</h2>

<p>The concept is simple: wire up some basic electronic components to an Arduino's input and output pins, and list what these components are in the Control Board interface.</p>

<p>The "Input" components (buttons, switches, potentiometers) will broadcast "ControlBoardInput" notifications when their state has changed along with what their current state is. Likewise, when you broadcast a "ControlBoardOutput" notification from a separate script to an "Output" component (an LED, motor, etc.), its state will change.</p>

<p>Control Board will try to connect to the first Arduino it finds connected over USB, click "Reconnect" to try connecting again if the board was plugged in after Control Board was opened.</p>

<p>Once connected, set up your circuit components in the Control Board interface. For instance, if you have a button connected to pin #2, add an "Input: Button/Switch" component, choose pin 2, and give the component a name. Click "Apply" to send this configuration to your Arduino board.</p>

<p>Now, each time your click the button, "ControlBoardInput" notifications will happen.</p>

<p>The notifications will always have an "info" dictionary. The dictionary has a key for the "type" of component ("Button/Switch", "Sensor", etc.), a "name" which is the name that you gave the component in the interface, and either a "state" ("up", "down") or a "value" (a sensor value between 0 and 1).</p>

<p>To post your own notifications, import the following method from RoboFont's mojo library:
<pre>    from mojo.events import postEvent</pre></p>

<p>Then, post your notification event to the desired component name, with the state the component should take, along with other optional arguments depending on the component. For example, you can turn an LED on by posting the following event:
<pre>    postEvent("ControlBoardOutput", 
    name="My LED", state="on")</pre>
and then turn it back off by posting this one:
<pre>    postEvent("ControlBoardOutput", 
    name="My LED", state="off")</pre></p>

<p>For a full explanation of all component states and values, check out the sample code in the /Examples directory and the table of Component Notifications at the end of this document.</p>


<h2>Basic Circuits</h2>

<p>(Coming soon?)</p>


<h2>Component Input/Output Notifications</h2>

<p>The incoming notifications tell a lot about how a component's state changed, and an outgoing notification needs to carry the kinds of details about how an output component should change.</p>

<p>See the example code in the /Examples directory for a guide to using the notifications documented below.</p>

<p>The "name" value is always the name assigned to the component in the Control Board interface. Otherwise, here's an overview of the attributes received when observing for a "ControlBoardInput" or sent with a "ControlBoardOutput" notification:</p>

<p><pre>Input: Button/Switch
    "name"
    "type":  "Button"
    "name":  The name assigned to the component 
             in the interface
    "state": "up", "down", or "hold" when the 
             button is held down for more than 
             one second 

Input: Rotary Encoder
    "name"
    "type":  "RotaryEncoder"
    "state": "changed"
    "value": "cw" if it was turned clockwise, or
             "ccw" if counter-clockwise

Input: Analog Sensor 
(Potentiometer, LDR, pressure sensor)
    "name"
    "type":  "AnalogSensor"
    "state": "changed"
    "value": A float between 0 and 1 of the 
             current sensor value

Output: LED
    "name"
    "state": "on", "off", "toggle", "blink"
    "value": When the state is "on", the value is
             a float between 0 and 1 to set the 
             brightness of the LED, when state is 
             "blink" the value is the frequency 
             time in milliseconds

Output: RGB LED
    "name"
    "state": "on", "off", "toggle", "blink"
    "value": When the state is "on", the value is 
             either a float between 0 and 1 to 
             set the brightness of all three  
             components, a list of three float 
             values for [R, G, B] between 0 and 1, 
             or the string of the name of a color, 
             such as "red", or "turquoise". When 
             the state is "blink", the value is the 
             value is the frequency time in 
             milliseconds

Output: Servo Motor
    "name"
    "position": The position the motor should turn
                to, in degrees between 0 and 180.

Output: DC Motor
    "name"
    "state": "on", "off"
    "value": When the state is "on", the value is 
             a float between 0 and 1 of the speed 
            the motor should turn
