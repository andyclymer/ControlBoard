# BreakfastSerial

A Firmata based framework for interacting with Arduinos over serial.

## Arduino Setup

In order to use BreakfastSerial, you need to have an arduino running the
standard firmata.

1. Download the Arduino IDE from the arduino website
  - [OSX](http://arduino.googlecode.com/files/arduino-1.0-macosx.zip)
  - [Linux 32 bit](http://arduino.googlecode.com/files/arduino-1.0-linux.tgz)
  - [Linux 64 bit](http://arduino.googlecode.com/files/arduino-1.0-linux64.tgz)
  - Windows support coming soon.
2. Plug in your Arduino or Arduino compatible microcontroller via USB
3. Open the Arduino IDE, select: File > Examples > Firmata > StandardFirmata
4. Click the "Upload" button.

## Installation

Using PyPi

``` bash
pip install BreakfastSerial
```

#### From Source

``` bash
git clone git://github.com/theycallmeswift/BreakfastSerial.git && cd BreakfastSerial

python setup.py install
```

## Getting Started

The BreakfastSerial library provides a simple abstraction for a number of
common components.  Make sure your arduino is plugged in and is running firmata.

### Arduino

If you create a `Arduino` object without any parameters, it will attempt to auto discover 
the serial port that the Arduino is attached to and connect automatically.  Optionally,
you can supply the path to a serial port (Ex. `"/dev/tty.usbmodem4111"`).

``` python
from BreakfastSerial import Arduino
board = Arduino() # This will autodiscover the device
```

### Blink an LED

To use the led object, import Led from `BreakfastSerial`.  The constructor takes an
Arduino object and a pin number as its arguments.

``` python
from BreakfastSerial import Arduino, Led
from time import sleep

board = Arduino()
pin = 13
led = Led(board, pin)

led.on()
sleep(2)
led.off()
```

You can also use the `blink` method and pass it a number of milliseconds to automate the blinking process

``` python
millis = 200
led.blink(millis)
```

### Push a button

The `Button` component has a number of helper methods that make it easy to work with buttons.
The constructor takes an Arduino object and a pin number as its arguments.

``` python
from BreakfastSerial import Button, Arduino

board = Arduino()
button = Button(board, 8)

def down_cb():
  print "button down"

def up_cb():
  print "button up"

def hold_cb():
  print "button held"

button.down(down_cb)
button.up(up_cb)
button.hold(hold_cb)
```

The `down` and `up` functions are just nice wrappers around the underlying event emitter.  The `Button`
component emits the following events:

 - `change` - The button value changed
 - `down` - The button is pressed
 - `up` - The button is not being pressed
 - `hold` - The button was held for at least 1 second

### Use an RGB Led

The `RGBLed` component lets us change the colors of an RGB Led without having to
interact with the three underlying leds.

```python
from BreakfastSerial import Arduino, RGBLed
from time import sleep

board = Arduino()
led = RGBLed(board, { "red": 10, "green": 9, "blue": 8 })

led.red()
sleep(1)

led.green()
sleep(1)

led.blue()
sleep(1)

led.yellow()
sleep(1)

led.cyan()
sleep(1)

led.purple()
sleep(1)

led.white()
sleep(1)

led.off()
```

### LED Brightness

You can set the brightness of an LED with the `brightness` function.  The LED
must be on a PWM capable pin or it will throw and error.  Brightness is
measured on a scale of 0% to 100%.

```python
from BreakfastSerial import Arduino, Led
from time import sleep

board = Arduino()
pin = 9
led = Led(board, pin)

for x in range(0, 100):
  led.brightness(x)
  sleep(0.01)
```

### Read a sensor

The `Sensor` component lets us read in data from a sensor (analog or digital).  The constructor takes in
an Arduino object and a pin number.

``` python
from BreakfastSerial import Arduino, Sensor

board = Arduino()
sensor = Sensor(board, "A0")

def print_value():
  print sensor.value

sensor.change(print_value)
```

The `Sensor` object has the following properties:

 - `threshold` - the amount `value` must change by to trigger a `change`
   event (Default: `0.01`)
 - `value` - the value of the underlying pin

The `change` function is just a nice wrapper around the underlying event emitter.  The `Sensor`
component emits the following events:

 - `change` - The sensor value change by at least the amount of `threshold`

### Control a servo
 
The `Servo` component let's us control a servo.  The constructor takes in
an Arduino object and a pin number.
 
``` python
from BreakfastSerial import Arduino, Servo
from time import sleep

board = Arduino()
servo = Servo(board, "10")

servo.set_position(180)
sleep(2)
servo.move(-135)
sleep(2)
servo.center()
sleep(2)
servo.reset()
```

The `value` property of a `Servo` object is the current position of the servo in degrees

### Control a DC Motor
 
The `Motor` component let's us control a DC Motor.  The constructor takes in
an Arduino object and a pin number.  The motor must be on a PWM capable pin.
 
``` python
from BreakfastSerial import Arduino, Motor
from time import sleep

board = Arduino()
motor = Motor(board, 9)

motor.start(80)
sleep(2)
motor.speed = 50
sleep(2)
motor.stop()
```

The `speed` property is represented in a percentage of max speed.  So, `speed
= 80` is setting the motor to 80% speed.  Setting `speed` equal to `0` is the 
same as calling `stop()`.

### Moar!

There are a bunch of examples in the `examples/` folder.  Additional components
will be added over time, so be sure to check back regularly.
